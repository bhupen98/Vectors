# Vectors
* Vector's are mathematical models that model both direction and magnitude. A Vector2 is 2D, and a Vector3 3D.

* A vector2(1,5) is a direction with the ratio of 1 part x, and 5 parts y. E.G a line 1/6th to the right, and 5/6th's up. a negative would make the line left and down respectively.

* Magnitude show's the "strength" of the direction. E.g when using forces and physics, pushing something in a vector2(1,0) is a much weaker push to the right than a vector2(100,0).
